# Area-consumption-of-wind-turbines
This is an attempt to calcluate the actual area consumption of the wind turbines in Rhineland-Palatinate. 
Eventually the electricity generated by wind turbines should be compared with the respective area consumption which then leads to an  assessment of the wind energy potential in Rhineland-Palatinat.
1. The csv file contains the merged data that origined from the master and movement operator Amprion and the market master data register (Marktstammdatenregister - MaStR) and contains the correct geographical information. The important variable names are (if \_m variable oiriginates from MaStR, if \_s variable originates from Amprion):
* eeg_nr: System key according to the Renewable Energy Act on which the merging of the two datasets has been done (EEG Anlagenschl√ºssel)
* leistung: Capacity of the wint turbine 
* indatum: Commissioning date 
* gem: Community key
* b\_wgs84: Latitude with CRS WGS84
* l\_wgs84: Longitude with CRS WGS84
* rotor: Rotor diameter \[m\]
* menge_kwh: Electricity yield in 2019 \[kWh]
* menge_mwh: Electricity yield in 2019 \[MWh\]
* flh: Full load hours in 2019
3. The R file creates a Leaflet map to display the data
4. The html file shows the output of the created Leaflet map on a glance
